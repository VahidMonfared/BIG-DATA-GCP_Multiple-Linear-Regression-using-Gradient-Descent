In this project, we will implement Batch Gradient Descent and Linear Regression to fit a line into two-dimensional data
set. You will implement a set of Spark jobs that will learn parameters for such lines from the New York
City Taxi trip reports in 2013. The dataset was released under the FOIL (The Freedom of Information
Law) and made public by Chris Whong (https://chriswhong. com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/).
